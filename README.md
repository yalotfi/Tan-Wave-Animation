# Tan-Wave-Animation

This was built in the p5 JavaScript framework for a website I am working on.  Very basic animation of a tan wave.  Change `tan()` to  `sin()` or `cos()` to change the wave animation.

Code is dependent on the p5.js libraries.  The HTML page is what I used for an iframe element in my website.
